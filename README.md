scraping playlists of radiostations, comparing the data, plotting plots.

To run the scraper, edit stations.toml and run the script using python main.py.
It creates a new folder 'data' and saves all the stations in a seperate .csv file.

sadly currently it starts to scrape from the beginning again. but i wanna update in the future. stay tuned.
